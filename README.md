# Input-Impedence-Variation
This project is based on wave transmission where the variation in input impedence is studied by varying various parameters.
Name : Lakshay
supervisor : Dr. Saptarshi Ghosh
Problem Statement :
Consider a plane wave (having angular frequency of ω rad/sec and phase constant of β
rad/m) propagating along a transmission line and terminated by a load impedance ZL. The
transmission line has a characteristic impedance of Zo (=Ro + jXo) and length of l. Plot the input
impedance Zi of the transmission line for different values of the load impedance ZL (=RL + jXL). Note:
the parameter l should be considered as input in terms of λ. The parameter values ω, β, l, R0, X0, RL,
XL will be provided from user-end.
